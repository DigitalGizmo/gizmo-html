	<p>The 1815 map presents Treat&rsquo;s and Neptune&rsquo;s canoe journey through Maine. Using Vue.js and Leaflet.js we geolocated markers on the map to delineate the route and to provide users access to Treat&rsquo;s journal. The visitor is introduced to the activity in the text to the left.</p>

	<h2>A Site Along the Journey</h2>
	<p>Tapping a marker zooms in and centers the map on that site and shows a brief description of the site. Visitors can choose to navigate sequentially through the journey or use the map to tap any marker. At each site, visitors can delve into Treat&rsquo;s journal entry that describes the location in sketches and prose.</p>
