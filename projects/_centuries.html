	<p>The website presents dozens of "Dress Up" activities that let the visitor interactively learn about the unfamiliar clothing that Americans have worn throughout our nation&apos;s history. Dress Up is one of the most popular features on the website. Note: This feature was created using Adobe Flash. In 2020 the Flash activities were rebuilt using modern open-source technologies to ensure their continued availability in contemporary browsers.</p>
