	<p>In the pre-dawn hours of February 29, 1704, a force of about 300 French and Native allies launched a daring raid on the English settlement of Deerfield, Massachusetts. 112 men, women, and children were captured and taken on a 300-mile forced march to Canada in harsh winter conditions. Was this raid in contested lands an unprovoked, brutal attack on an innocent village of English settlers? Was it a justified military action against a stockaded settlement in a Native homeland? Or was it something else? This website presents all sides of the story so the user can decide.</p>
