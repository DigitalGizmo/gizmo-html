	<h2>Laser Cooling Interactive</h2>
	<p>The website includes three hands-on labs to help visitors conduct virtual experiments. The goal of this activity is to slow the atoms so they can be captured in the trap. This is acheived by setting the temperature of the oven and adjusting the strength of the magnets. Note: This feature was created  before the widespread adoption of HTML5 and was programmed in Flash which will not play on some browsers and devices. Flash files will play in Chrome with the Flash plug-in installed.</p>
