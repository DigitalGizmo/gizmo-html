	<h2>About this site</h2>
	<p>Place-based, people-centered, and image-rich, the Picturing Urban Renewal website introduces users to the complicated and controversial history of the effort to remake our nationâ€™s cities. It is structured around the experiences of four cities in New York State: Manhattan, Albany, Kingston and Newburgh. Each city has a different story to tell and taken together, these four stories present a broad picture of urban renewal and its short and long-term impacts. In collaboration with scholars from the University of Albany, we&apos;ve recently completed work on an National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Digital Projects for the Public Prototype phase to envision this ambitious website that includes a rich archive of photographs and ephemera, dozens of personal stories, immersive video and long-form, richly visual narratives.</p>

	<h2>Sidewalk Strolls</h2>
	<p>One feature of the website that has been prototyped is "Sidewalk Strolls". Visitors can virtually explore the city as experienced by those who lived and worked there, a place typically traveled on foot. By stitching together period photographs, we've recreated lost streetscapes that visitors can move along, examining the people, objects and architecture that defined these vanished neighborhoods. </p>
