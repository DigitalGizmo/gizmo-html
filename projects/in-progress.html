    <h2>Picturing Urban Renewal</h2>
    <p>Picturing Urban Renewal explores the history of urban renewal in four cities in New York State: Manhattan, Albany, Kingston and Newburgh. Each city has a different story to tell and taken together, these four stories present a broad picture of urban renewal and its short and long-term impacts. In collaboration with scholars from the University of Albany, we&apos;ve recently completed work on an National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Digital Projects for the Public Prototype phase to envision this ambitious website that includes a rich archive of photographs and ephemera, dozens of personal stories, immersive video and long-form, richly visual narratives.</p>

    <h2>Lucy Terry Prince: A Window into African American Life in Early Rural New England</h2>
    <p>We recently completed the planning stages of a website that explores the long, well-documented life of an African American woman whose experiences, from her birth and captivity in Africa around 1730, to her enslavement in Massachusetts, to her death as a free woman in Vermont in 1821, encompass most of the signal events of the lives of enslaved people in New England. The website is designed as an emotionally engaging, immersive personal narrative supported by contextual, historical material that users can explore in a more user-directed, interactive experience. This project is being developed with our long-time colleagues at the Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association and is funded by the NEH.</p>

    <h2>Rebuilding A Legacy Website: The New American Centuries</h2>
    <p>We&apos;re renovating and updating an aging but still popular website that we developed many years ago: American Centuries. With a major grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) we are completely reorganizing, redesigning and rebuilding the website to bring its time-tested content up to modern user experience standards. This website will be launched in 2024.</p>
