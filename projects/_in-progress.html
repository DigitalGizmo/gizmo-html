	<h2>African Americans In the Record</h2>
	<p>This growing database already includes over 2,000 African American-related entries found in 18th century documents from Western Massachusetts. The majority of the sources are from Deerfield, Massachusetts where, by the mid-18th century, 38% of households included enslaved people. The earliest record dates to 1695.</p>
